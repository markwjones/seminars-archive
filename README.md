## Seminars Archive

The Department of Computer Science, Swansea University placed invited seminar details online from 1993. When the university moved to a content server, all new talks were placed onto the new CMS. The previous seminars were still available on the old php website.

As future maintenance is not a priority, it was decided to extract all the source SQL as a SQLite database (available in this repo as seminar.db) and roughly convert the web pages to html. Jekyll would have been a good idea, but it was simpler and faster (for me) to do it this way keeping all the old css etc. Given more time, a nicer job could be made, but it was not a priority.

By making this repo public, all the data is available if someone wants to resurrect it in the future and do a better job. After up to three decades, many of the links to author home pages and other destinations are broken.
