<h1>The Semantic Web as the apotheosis of annotation, but what are its semantics?</h1>
<h2><a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~yorick/">Yorick Wilks</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/">University of Sheffield</a></p>
<p>The paper discusses what kind of entity the proposed Semantic Web (SW) is, and<br />does so principally by reference to the relationship of natural language<br />structure to knowledge representation (KR). It argues that there are three<br />distinct views on the issue: first, that the SW is basically a renaming of the<br />traditional AI knowledge representation task, with all its problems and<br />challenges. If that is the case, as some believe, then there is no particular<br />reason to expect progress in any new form of presentation of this issue, as<br />all the traditional problems of logic and representation will reappear, ones<br />that have resisted definitive solutions within AI for fifty years. That route<br />will be no more successful outside the narrow scientific domains where KR<br />seems to work, even though the formal ontology movement has undoubtedly<br />brought benefits. The paper contains some discussion of the relationship of<br />current SW doctrine to representation issues covered by traditional AI, and<br />also discusses the issues of how far SW proposals are able to deal with<br />difficult semantic relationships in some well-defined areas of e-science.<br /><br /><br />Secondly, there is a view that the SW will be, at a minimum, the WorldWideWeb<br />(WWW) with its constituent documents annotated so as to yield their content,<br />or meaning structure, more directly. This view of the SW makes natural<br />language processing central as the procedural bridge from texts to KR, usually<br />via some form of automated Information Extraction. This view is discussed in<br />some detail and it is argued that this can also be seen as a way of justifying<br />the structures used as KR for the SW. There is a third view, possibly<br />Berners-Lee's own, that the SW is about trusted databases as the foundation of<br />a system of web processes and services, but it is argued that this ignores the<br />whole history of the web as a textual system, and gives no better guarantee of<br />agreed meanings for terms than the other two approaches. There is also a<br />fourth view, much harder to define and discuss, which is that if the SW just<br />keeps moving as an engineering development and is lucky (as the successful<br />scale-up of the WWW seems to have been luckier, or better designed, than many<br />cynics expected) then real problems will not arise. This view is a hunch and<br />not open to close analysis but one can only wish it well, as it were, without<br />being able to discuss it in detail further at this stage. In this paper we<br />will concentrate on the first three approaches, their problems and their<br />possible solutions.</p>
