<h1>The 4 in ICT4D: making computer science relevant in a development context</h1>
<h2><a href="">Tim Unwin</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.gg.rhul.ac.uk/Tim/">Royal Holloway</a></p>
<p>Tim Unwin (born 1955) is UNESCO Chair in ICT4D and Professor of Geography at Royal Holloway, University of London. From 2001-2004 he led the UK Prime Minister's Imfundo: Partnership for IT in Education initiative based within the Department for International Development, and he is currently Senior Advisor to the World Economic Forum's Partnerships for Education initiative with UNESCO, a High Level Advisor for the UN's Global Alliance for ICT and Development, and President of the Advisory Board of Eduvision. He was previously Head of the Department of Geography at Royal Holloway, University of London between 1999 and 2001, and has also served as Honorary Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society (with The Institute of British Geographers) (1995-1997). He has written or edited 13 books, and over 170 papers and other publications, including \"Wine and the Vine\" (Routledge, 1991; translated into three languages), \"The Place of Geography\" (Longman, 1992), as well as his edited \"Atlas of World Development\" (Wiley, 1994) and \"A European Geography\" (Longman, 1998). His research has taken him to more than 25 countries across the world, from Sénégal to Singapore, and Estonia to Ethiopia, and he has worked on subjects as diverse as the role of banknotes as expressions of national identity, and the educational needs of out of school youth in the Philippines. His recent research has concentrated especially on ICT4D, focusing on its use in the context of teacher training in Africa, on a critique of budget support mechanisms in international aid, and on the use of partnerships in ICT4D practice. He has recently completed a collaborative book on ICT4D to be published by Cambridge University Press in 2008. The UK's Secretary of State for International Development appointed him as a Commonwealth Scholarship Commissioner in 2004; he also serves as Academic Advisor and External Examiner of the Institute of Masters of Wine. He is a frequently invited keynote speaker, facilitator and moderator at high level international meetings, including the World Economic Forum's annual meetings in Davos, UNESCO round tables, WSIS follow-up meetings (such as the ICT 4 All Tunis + 2 Forum in Tunisia in 2007), Online Educa, e-Learning Africa, and bilateral donor events (such as BMZ's Capacity Development Forum in 2008)</p>
